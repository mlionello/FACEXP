# Facexp Project

## Overview
Facexp is a project featuring multiple strategies for analyzing facial expressions during naturalistic face recording acquisition. It explores interpretable and accurate framework for facial expression recognition.

## Introduction
Facial expressions serve as immediate means for communicating emotions. Recognizing facial expressions in real-world settings, known as facial expression recognition in the wild (FER), 
holds significant importance for social, commercial, and scientific endeavors. While Deep Learning models (DNN) excel in FER, they often lack self-explanatory features. In response, our 
framework proposes a methodology based on pairwise distances between facial landmarks, [which we validate using three datasets](https://github.com/mlionello/FACEXP/tree/master/facexp/prerpoc_and_analysis_code/classifiers4sipf).

[A second study](https://github.com/mlionello/FACEXP/tree/master/facexp/prerpoc_and_analysis_code/facecircus) involved 21 participants watching a 20-minute movie while their facial expressions were recorded and analyzed for synchronized emotional responses using t-ISC, 
correlating with reported emotional peaks, suggesting potential for wider applications.
